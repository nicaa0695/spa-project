# Single Page App - Household Tasks

Single Page Application to keep track of family chores/tasks.
The app has a Rails API backend and a JavaScript frontend.

# Motivation

I've decided to create this app to help other families as well as my own to help keep household tasks/chores organized. Users are able to create housholds and add tasks to those households as well as mark them complete/incomplete and delete them.

# Highlights

-Developed a Rails API backend with an HTML, CSS, and Javascript
frontend.Used Object Oriented Javascript (classes) to encapsulate related
data and behavior.
-Used JSON as the communication format. All interactions between the
client/server are handled asynchronously using AJAX.
-Rails API uses RESTful conventions and has a Sqlite database.

# How To Use

Clone the repository and run: 'rails s' for API Reference and then 'npx reload -b' to start the application.
Click 'Add A New Household', type in family last name and any first names.
Click 'Add A New Chore', select which household the chore should belong to.
Click 'Select Your Family' to view all of your household's chores.
Towards the bottom of your page, you can mark your chores complete/incomplete as well as delete them.
