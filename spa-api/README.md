# README

Single Page Application to keep track of family chores/tasks. Users are able to create housholds and add tasks to those households as well as mark them complete/incomplete and delete them.
The app has a Rails backend and a JavaScript frontend.

Clone the repository and run: 'rails s' and then 'npx reload -b' to start the application.

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.
